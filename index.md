### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs from this semester. Being the first thing I coded this year, I remember struggling to get the code to change the message from â€œHello Tuffy" to my name and my partners. From trial and error we realized  that we never saved the new updated file. After that it worked perfectly.

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part-2 what made this one of the best labs was that we had to create code that searches through a list of states. And then labels the most dense state. 

* Lab 11

Lab 11, part-2 was a good lab throughout the semester. Part had the hilo code which for the most part just checks the users guesses and gives a corresponding message to their guess. And tells them how many guess they have remaining.
